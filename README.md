### NATO Alphabet Generator

- The NATO Alphabet Generator is a Python program that converts a word into its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet code. The program reads the NATO alphabet from a CSV file and allows users to input a word, then outputs the phonetic alphabet representation. It includes exception handling to ensure that only valid alphabetic inputs are processed.

### Features:

- Phonetic Conversion: Converts any word into its NATO phonetic alphabet representation.
- User Input Handling: Accepts user input, transforms it to uppercase, and returns the NATO code.
- Exception Handling: If the user enters invalid characters (non-alphabetical), the program will prompt them again without crashing.
- Efficient CSV Data Reading: Reads the NATO alphabet from a CSV file using pandas to create a dictionary for easy access.
